To help drivers avoid congestion, traffic forecast information is used to create Anticipatory Traveller Information Systems (ATIS). By using ATIS, drivers can adapt their routes to changing traffic demands reducing their own travel time and that of other non-participating drivers. However, maintaining forecast information for large road networks is a challenge because of dynamic and distributed nature of traffic.

By aggregating drivers intentions, the route they intent to follow, at the relevant network links we calculate intention levels. The intention level of a link at a certain point in time is the number of vehicle that have shared their intention to traverse that link at that point in time. Assuming there is a correlation between the intention level and the actual traffic density, we can use these levels to infer future demand and forecast link traversal times.

The assumption that there exists a correlation between intention levels and traffic densities relies on the participation rate of the ATIS. If all drivers participate and share their intentions, the intention levels will closely reflect the traffic density of the links. However, if the participation rate is too low, insufficient information about drivers intentions will cause the traffic density estimation to be erroneous and these errors will propagate into the estimated traversal times.

It is therefore crucial for the ATIS to be able to adapt to varying participation levels. In our work, we do this by learning the relationship between the intention levels, the traffic density and the traversal times for each individual link. The use of machine learning techniques allows the system to adapt to variations in participation rates both in space and time.

In this talk, I will give an overview on how our ATIS adapts to different participation rates and how the system allows drivers behaviour and route choice to adapt to changing traffic demand.
